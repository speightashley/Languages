# Model Aux Verbs

A Model Verbs is a helping verb that can change the mood of a sentence and modify the meaning of a following verb. "To have" and "To be" are also classed as aux verbs but are covered in unit 1

## Present Tense Positioning

When we use a model aux verb, the conjugated form of this takes the first position in the sentence and the infinitive of the verb that follows is placed at the end of the sentence:
