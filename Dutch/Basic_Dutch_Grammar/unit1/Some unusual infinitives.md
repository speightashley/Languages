The following infinitives change because of the short form of them. Each one doesn't drop the entire root.

[[Gaan - To go]]
[[Zien - To See]]
[[Doen - To do]]

Take note that [[Slaan - To hit]] and [[Staan - To stand]] follow the same pattern as [[Gaan - To go]]

## Changing spellings to suit the verb

With two verbs like Spelen and Spellen we need a way to maintain the sound when conjugated.

To do this, we extend the e in spelen to make Ik speel. The spellen verb drops for second L and it becomes Ik Spel. This maintains the sound of the verb.
