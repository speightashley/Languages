## Changing spellings to suit the verb sound

With two verbs like Spelen and Spellen we need a way to maintain the sound when conjugated.

To do this, we extend the e in spelen to make Ik speel. The spellen verb drops for second L and it becomes Ik Spel. This maintains the sound of the verb. 

Verbs that follow this pattern are:

[[Spelen]]
[[Spellen]]
[[Wonen]]
[[Winnen]]
[[Spreken]]
[[Trekken]]
[[Laten]]
[[zitten]]

## Dropping -v and -z at the ends of words in place of a hard consonant

We can't have -v or -z at the end of words in dutch and thus some verbs change their final letter in certain constructs.

Strong examples are with Geven (to give) and Wijzen (To point).

We swap the -Z for an -S and we swap the -V for an -F
